# Regression Analysis


## Data Exploration
First we try to understand the data a bit more with regards to outliers and how well some variables predict others.

## Linear Regression 
We compare standard OLS MLR and robust regression using Huber loss to see what is more effective.

## PCA
We use an unsupervised approach to see if adding interaction terms and then reconstructing variables as principle components helps better understand the data

## PCR 
Principle components regression runs a linear regression on the first N1, N2, and N3 principle components 




P.S. I use "we" but the work is my own.
